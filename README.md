# Still under construction.

To Run this:
   1) 'GPT-Chat-GUIs/GPT' Api Client/requirements.txt has to be installed in the 'GPT Api Client' project.
   2) An .env file has to be present in the 'GPT-Chat-GUIs/GPT Api Client/Persistent_Data/' directory, with the following variables set:
       OPENAI_ORGANIZATION= ;Found here https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings
       OPENAI_API_KEY= ;Found here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
       MODEL_ID= ;E.g. 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301'
   
Things to be aware of, for now:
       1) 'GPT Api Client' will not be copied into the Middleware project if it has not been build manually before running the program. As it does not build automatically when           startet.
       2) The path to the root directory cannot be very long, and there is no warning telling you what the problem is, if that is the case.
       3) This software is still in the very early days of development. Expect a few bugs, missing features and a very ugly GUI.
